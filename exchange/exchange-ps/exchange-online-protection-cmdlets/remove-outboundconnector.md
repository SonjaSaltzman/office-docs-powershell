You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.OutboundConnectorIdParameter  <br/> |The  _Identity_ parameter specifies the connector you want to remove. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
